# 🔬 Particle Simulation  

A collection of **numerical simulations** modeling particle interactions using the **Verlet integration method**.  

This project explores:  
- **Gravitational motion** (free-fall simulation)  
- **Interacting particles with the Lennard-Jones potential**  
- **Phase transitions using the Andersen thermostat**  

This project was carried out as part of the Computational Physics course (Master's 1).    
The code in this repositorie is not complete in relation to the project presented for the course. It is missing calculations of physical quantities that are important for phase transitions, such as Cv.  
This is why the report will be published once these elements have been added to the program (no date set).

## Project Overview  

### 1. **Free-Fall Simulation (Introduction to Verlet Integration)**  
- Simulates a **particle under gravity** using the Verlet algorithm.  
- Demonstrates the accuracy of **symplectic integration** over time.  
- **Visualized with Matplotlib animations** [free-fall.mp4](free-fall/free-fall.mp4)  
- **Code:** [free-fall.py](free-fall/free-fall.py)

### 2. **Lennard-Jones Potential (Particle Interactions)**  
- Models **interactions between particles** using the **Lennard-Jones potential**.  
- Simulates **attractive and repulsive forces** at different distances.  
- Used to study **molecular interactions** and **phase behavior**.  
- **Visualization:** [lennard-jones.mp4](lennard-jones/lennard-jones.mp4)  
- **Code:** [lennard-jones.py](lennard-jones/lennard-jones.py)

### 3. **Phase Transition Simulation (Liquid-Solid Transition)**  
- Implements a **2D phase transition** from liquid to solid.  
- Uses the **Andersen thermostat** to control temperature.  
- Demonstrates the emergence of **crystalline structures** from disordered motion.  
- Result : ![phase-transition-Temperature.png](phase-transition/phase-transition-Temperature.png)  
- **Visualization:** [phase-transition.mp4](phase-transition/phase-transition.mp4)  
- **Code:** [phase-transition.py](phase-transition/phase-transition.py)
